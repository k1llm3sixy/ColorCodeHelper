# ColorCodeHelper

Minecraft mod that allows you to view the available colors in Minecraft, copy these colors easily, and test messages with colors directly in-game

## Features

- View all available Minecraft color codes
- Copy color codes for easy use
- Test messages with color codes to see how they will appear in chat

## Commands

- `/colorhelper` - Help

- `/colorhelper test <message>` - Allows you to test your message with colors

- `/colorhelper colors` - Displays the available color codes

## Notes

Most servers use the ampersand (`&`) instead of the section sign (`ยง`), which is invisible in Minecraft chat and cannot be used directly

The `/colorhelper test` command automatically replaces the ampersand (`&`) with the section sign (`ยง`) for proper color rendering
